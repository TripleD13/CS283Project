/**
 * Board class that represents the current state of a Catan board.
 * Uses a 3-dimensional coordinate system where each point is represented as
 * the ordered tuple (x, y, z). x and y represent the position of the tile, and
 * z represents the point on the tile. Because each point on the board has
 * three possible coordinate representations, points are normalized so that
 * each point stored on the map has a coordinate that either represents
 * the top right point of a tile of the right point of a tile.
