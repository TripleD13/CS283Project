Server Usage
============
To start the server, open up a command line prompt and navigate to the .jar file. 

ServerMain.jar <Port> 

Enter your desired port for the server. We used 64000. Be sure to pick one that is not
already in use by the operating system.

Client Usage
============
To start the client, open up a command line prompt and navigate to the .jar file.

ClientMain.jar <IP Address> <Port>

Enter in the IP address used by the server, and the port the server specified. 


Notes to remember
=================
The game will not begin until four players have joined a lobby. At that moment, the game
will begin immediately.
